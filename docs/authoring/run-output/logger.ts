// A tiny logger, because Node has no standard one. Use it like the standard loggers of the other languages:
//   const log = logger("prompt-builder");  log.debug("input", spec);
// It writes `[log:<test>] LEVEL name: message` lines to stdout, naming the test that was running, so the report can show
// each line under its test. Imported by the practice's own file, it registers one test hook; the file still runs outside the tests.
import { beforeEach } from "node:test";
let current = "";

    const text = parts.map((part) => (typeof part === "string" ? part : JSON.stringify(part))).join(" ");
    process.stdout.write(`[log:${current}] ${level} ${name}: ${text}\n`);
  };
  return { debug: write("DEBUG"), info: write("INFO"), warn: write("WARN"), error: write("ERROR") };
